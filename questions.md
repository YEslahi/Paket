1. should i use the ImageDataGenerator from Keras itself to do augmentation or should i do manual augmentations?
2. how many images out of 1 image should i create ? 
3. apart from randomcrop, which of the other augmentations are good for our usecase? 
4. should we think of multilabel classification or we consider there will be always one photo?

5. augmentation is done but the it is not the good part of the image which are cropped. mostly the corners. how to make sure the parts that are more importat are still in there?

6. when i use a pretrained model, till which layer should i use it?

7. which layers are better for drop out?
